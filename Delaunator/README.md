## About 

This project is simply a representation of the results obtained with
the <a href="https://github.com/delfrrr/delaunator-cpp/tree/master">delfrrr/delaunator-cpp</a>
library, which is a C++ port from <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator">mapbox/delaunator</a>
(a JavaScript implementation of a very fast 2D Delaunay algorithm).

This implementation will be useful in the <a href="https://github.com/dpv927/raylib/tree/main/MapGeneration">MapGeneration</a> project to generate a graph of rooms on a randomly generated map, as the author of the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/278620/TinyKeep/">TinyKeep</a> explains about its implementation.
