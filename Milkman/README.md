## About 

This project is a series of tests to see the different mechanisms of a
2D roguelike. It can be seen in the source code and files that we are looking for an 
code architecture that allows the code to be extended, for example by adding 
adding eneigos, objects, etc.

Although right now there is no clear goal, this project may be developed further to form a complete game.
further developed to form a complete game.
