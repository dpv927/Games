## About 

A square that bounces along the walls of the window and changes color, as
in the <a href="https://github.com/dpv927/raylib/tree/main/crazyRGB">CrazyRGB</a>
example. The objective is to make a behavior similar to the screen-savers of years
ago, as Windows XP had to prevent the screens from being damaged by always showing
the same content, but this time without that purpose.
